# DO NOT USE THE SHOCKER ON YOUR NECK! BEST TO STAY BELOW THE WAIST!
## the current quality of the datatset and model is not good. This project is not yet ready for use
this came out of a converstion in the [PiShock (18+)](https://pishock.com) Discord, 

where someone told me to make a keysmash sensor that would shock me when I keysmash.

this was a joke, why did I actualy decide to do this... 
help.


#  THIS IS BASED HEAVLY ON https://towardsdatascience.com/character-level-cnn-with-keras-50391c3adf33 and https://mobile.twitter.com/hexcubic works


```train.py``` and ```build_dataset.py``` are slightly modfied from  https://mobile.twitter.com/hexcubic stuff

Keysmashes are/will be from me asking for keysmashes in chats.

## TODO
- [ ] get better datatset
- [ ] make readme not bad
- [ ] create libary for PiShock
- [ ] work on methdo of getting realtime input
