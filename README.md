my READMEs are not normaly like this, just an fyi, also I still need to get spellcheck installed on my IDE
as of right now, this can't tell if someone has keysmashed or not. it also can't give zappies, i wont be able to test that till I get my PiShock either, but the PiShock api is straight forward, so yee

keysmash dataset was made using the thing in tools/keysmashgen.html which is adapted from https://github.com/galenguyer/galenguyer.github.io.v1/blob/7bac2fa62bf89dd97e4321faa745bf3fd2a08c06/keysmash.html

this readme is shit, it might get better, it might not.  

this came out of a converstion in the [PiShock (18+)](https://pishock.com) Discord, 

where someone told me to make a keysmash sensor that would shock me when I keysmash.

this was a joke, why did I actualy decide to do this... 
help.



this uses fasttext as the trainer thingy, idk what to call it,
