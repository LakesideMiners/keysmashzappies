my READMEs are not normaly like this, just an fyi, also I still need to get spellcheck installed on my IDE
as of right now, this can't tell if someone has keysmashed or not. it also can't give zappies, i wont be able to test that till I get my PiShock either, but the PiShock api is straight forward, so yee

words.txt is the oxford 5000
this readme is shit, it might get better, it might not.  

this came out of a converstion in the [PiShock (18+)](https://pishock.com) Discord, 

where someone told me to make a keysmash sensor that would shock me when I keysmash.

this was a joke, why did I actualy decide to do this... 
help.
