I have stuff from oxford 5000, corncobs misspelling list, 
keysmashes were made from https://github.com/galenguyer/galenguyer.github.io.v1/blob/7bac2fa62bf89dd97e4321faa745bf3fd2a08c06/keysmash.html

this came out of a converstion in the [PiShock (18+)](https://pishock.com) Discord, 

where someone told me to make a keysmash sensor that would shock me when I keysmash.

this was a joke, why did I actualy decide to do this... 
help.
